# EgilsSagaLaTeX
My experiments with LaTeX, expressed through my typesetting of the Icelandic Saga "Egil's Saga".

The text for the saga comes from the [Icelandic Saga Database](https://www.sagadb.org "Icelandic Saga Database"). The original text has been modified slightly, fixing some encoding issues with the &aelig character, changing it to the LaTeX special character `\ae`.
